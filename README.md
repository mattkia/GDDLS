Geodescially Driven Deep Level Sets for Salient Objects Detection

Here is the codes of the paper **Geodesically Driven Deep Level Sets for Salient Objects Detection**. You can find how to use the codes from **notes.txt**.
The datasets are not uploaded due to the high volume of the data. However, the datasets used in this paper include **CAMO**, **DUT-OMRON**, **ECSSD**, **PASCAL-VOC**
 and **HKU-IS**.
